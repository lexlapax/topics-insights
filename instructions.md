*   Save time and effort: Eliminate the need for users to manually search and filter through multiple sources to stay up-to-date.
*   Deliver high-quality information: Provide accurate, comprehensive, and deduplicated news summaries with links to original sources.
*   Enable insightful discovery: Surface key concepts and entities related to each news story for deeper understanding and potential research.
*   Scalable and maintainable: Build a robust and scalable system to support a growing number of topics and users.

## 3. Target Audience

*   Researchers: Staying updated on the latest research and developments in their fields.
*   Journalists: Gathering background information and tracking emerging trends for their reporting.
*   Analysts: Monitoring specific industries or companies for market insights.
*   Students: Learning about current events and researching specific topics.
*   Anyone interested in staying informed: General users who want to easily follow developments in areas they are passionate about.


## 4. Product Overview

Topic Insights is a web application that automates the process of gathering, summarizing, and analyzing news content related to user-defined topics. The application fetches data from multiple sources, uses advanced algorithms to identify relevant information, deduplicates articles, generates concise summaries, and extracts key concepts. The summaries and metadata are stored for future access and analysis.
